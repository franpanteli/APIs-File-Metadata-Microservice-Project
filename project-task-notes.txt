These are my notes on the project task page. This project is called "File Metadata Microservice." The URL for the page which these notes are on is https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/file-metadata-microservice

- We are building a full-stack JavaScript application 
	-> We want it to be similar in functionality to this https://file-metadata-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/ 
	-> The multer npm package can be used to handle file uploading for this

- We can do this using three different methods:
	#1 Locally <- clone their boilerplate code and complete the project locally 
		-> The link to their boilerplate code is https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-filemetadata/ 

	#2 Gitpod <- they also have a Gitpod starter project which you can use 

	#3 A site builder
		-> They don't specify which site builder to use 
		-> This needs to include all of the files from the project GitHub repository, since there are unit tests for the project which depend on this 

- Tests for the project submission:
	-> You should provide your project, not the example URL
	-> You can submit a form that includes a file upload
	-> The form file input field has the name attribute set to upfile
	-> When you submit a file, you receive the file name, type, and size in bytes within the JSON response
